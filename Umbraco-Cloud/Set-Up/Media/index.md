# Media on Umbraco Cloud

:::warning
We are currently migrating all media libraries on Umbraco Cloud projects to Azure Blob Storage.

You can follow the process here on the [Umbraco Cloud Statuspage](https://status.umbraco.io/incidents/hfnq16mq7l1k).

In the article below, you can find more information about Azure Blob Storage and how it works with your Umbraco Cloud project.
:::

All media files on your Umbraco Cloud projects are stored using Azure Blob Storage. This means that the media files are not stored with the rest of your project files but in an external storage system.

In order to access the media files on your Umbraco Cloud project [you can connect to Azure Storage Explorer.](Connect-to-Azure-Storage-Explorer)
