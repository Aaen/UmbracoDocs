![Logos widget icon](images/The-Logos-Widget.png)

The Logos Widget does what the name implies, and lets you add a set of logos to your website.
You can choose what images you will use for logos, and what pages they need to link to and/or you can add text to it.

The configuration for this widget is divided into two parts:

## Sample
