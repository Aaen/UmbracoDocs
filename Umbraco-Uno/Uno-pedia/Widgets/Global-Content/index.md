What this widget does for you, is that it allows you to pick pre-made widgets, also called Global Content.

To learn more about how to create Global Content, you can read the [Global Content](../../Content-Types/Global-Content/index.md) article.

Once you've added the Global Content Widget to your page, follow these steps to select which Global Content you want to use:

- Click "Add"
- From the dialog in the right-hand side, expand the folder containing your Global Content (click the arrow next to it)
- Finally, select which of your pre-made widgets you want to add to your page

Keep in mind that in order for there to be anything to select, you will have to have set-up some widgets using the [Global Content](../../Content-Types/Global-Content/index.md) feature.

This is a very useful tool if you have a widget that you use a lot and want to look the same on multiple pages.

See below an example, of what it might look like. In this example, there is a Hero Widget which have been created as Global Content and can therefore by selected with The Global Content Widget.
