# Slider

![Slider widget icon](images/The-Slider-Widget.png)

The Slider Widget allows you to pick 1 or more widgets to display in a slideshow.

## Sample

![Frontend example of a slider with 2 pages, and both page dots and arrows enabled](images/Slider-example.png)

## Configuration options

- Choose how fast the transition between widgets is. Note that 1000 is equal to 1 second.
- Decide whether you want the slider to have arrows on the edges which takes you through the slides.
- Enable dots in the buttom to show what slide you are currently on.
- Make the slider pause when you hover over it.
- Choose to have the slider ***Wrap Around*** to make it loop between the widgets indefinitely.  
- Make the transition between slides more seamless by using ***Fade Animation***.

:::note
For the best experience with the Slider Widget, we recommend adding multiple ***Image Widgets*** containing one image each.
