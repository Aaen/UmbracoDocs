# How to set up a landingpage

This is a guide designed to help you make a nice landing page, for your website.
In each step, one feature will be covered. It is important to note that this guide will not cover all options you will have in terms of features.

The Result should look somewhat like this:

## First Step

- Start by right-clicking the Umbraco Hotel node
- Choose Create and select **Page**
- Name your landing page and you are ready to start creating your new landing page
- In the Content group of your page, navigate to the Widget section and click ***Add content***

## Hero

We will start by adding a greeting to our page. This will be done using the Hero widget, as it allows for having text on top of a background image in a good way.

- Pre heading: Add part of your heading here - it will be in a smaller font size above the actual Heading
- Heading: This is the main part of the heading so this will be in a larger font size
- The text will be below the heading and in a smaller font size
- Add a background image
- Choose a dark or light theme for the text depending on the colors of your image
- Container Width: Full width
- Text width: 50%
- Height: 70%
- Overlay: 60%
- Text Align: Center
- Vertical text-align: Top
- Animate turned on
- Click ***Save*** in the bottom of the page
- Go to the top of the hero and click the hero tab to minimize it
